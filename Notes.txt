1. Distributed VCS (Version Control System).

2. Uses:
Branching,
Merging,
Commiting,
Push and Pull

3. SVN is centralised version control (like, CVCS) but git is a distributed version control system (DVCS).

4.Basic GIT commands:
init, status, add, commit, log, push, pull, merge

5.To get local copy of any repository use git clone
git clone http://---repository_path---

6. To add file to a staging area. Use:
git add fileName or git add . (For everything)

7. To commit content in staging area,
git commit -m "Message for commit"

8. To push changes to the remote repository finally, use:
git push origin master

9. To get status whether there is anything to be committed.
git status

10. Three states in Git project
Modifies, Staged and Committed

11. To initialize empty git repository, use:
git init

After git init, the directory should have '.git' file.

12) To add remote repo in local, use:
git remote add origin GIT_REPO_PATH. (This links between remote repository and local repository).

13) To undo the file from staging area:
git reset HEAD index.html

14) To uncomit a file from a committed section
git reset --soft HEAD~1

15) Undoing a pushed change
git revert HEAD. It opens an editor.
I reverts all local changes to the beginning and now you can push changes again as git push origin master.

16) To see git logs in a beautiful way:
git log --pretty=oneline

17) To see difference between files:
git diff <FILE_NAME>

18) To update content in local repo:
git fetch // It fetches content in local repository
get merge origin/master //It merges changes fetched from remote.

19) Git pull:
It is a combination of git fetch and git merge commands:
git pull origin master

20) To list out all branches:
git branch -a

21) create new branch:
git branch <branch_name>

22) To switch to new branch:
git checkout <branch_name>

23) To create and switch in a single command:
git checkout -b <branch_name>

24) To rename branch:
git branch -m <old_branch_name> <new_branch_name>

25) To delete a branch:
First switch to some other branch because current branch can't be deleted.
git branch -d <brance_to_be_deleted>

26) Merging of branches:
git merge
git merge <branch_name>
